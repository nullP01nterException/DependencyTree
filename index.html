	    Title: Dependency Tree
	    Artists: Jolina Lam and Grace O'Hair-Sherman
	    We have chosen to illustrate the influence of the protagonistsâ€™ relationships and their ethnicity to their identity in all three core books. This project's map represents the influence of ethnicity and the family trees illustrates the influence of relationships, familial and otherwise, on identity.
