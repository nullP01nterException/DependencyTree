	    <p>
	    	<b>Identities</b> are unique because we make them unique.  We have control over some aspects of our identities, and we can change part of our identities when we want to.  <br>However, there is another part of our identities that we are born into and cannot change, and this also makes us unique.  This part of our identities is made up of our <br>family histories and the relationships we have with the unique people who make up our histories.  This game examines the identities of the characters in <i>Dreaming <br>in Cuban: A Novel</i> by Cristina Garcia, <i>Bad Indians: A Tribal Memoir</i> by Deborah A. Miranda, and <i>The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</i> by Anne Fadiman.
